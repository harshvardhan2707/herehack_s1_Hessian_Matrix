## Problem Statement
**20-min city** : "Provide application users with POIs within 20 mins of travel distance depending on the category requested by user (e.g. - user searches for nearby dine-in restaurants for his location, provide list of restuarants in 20 mins of reach to user)"<br>
<br>
## Idea/ Solution
**Main goal** : Having access to all the essential services and accommodations within short time period and minimal distance coverage<br>
**Our solution** : Keeping vital locations (medical facilities, schools, parks etc) within walking distance<br>
<br>
### The Application
Map with POI displayed as cards<br>
Side-menu for selected location which contains location information, like the name, image, rating and associated contact details<br>
Utilizing HERE's MAP Rendering and API services<br>
<br>
## Technology Stack
**Website development** : HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React<br>
**Geolocation tagging** (and development of other location-based features) : HERE APIs (other APIs if needed)<br>
